      <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>

We thrive in complex, regulated environments and specialize in handling projects that require precision, discipline, and dependable follow-through. At CurtRidge, we take pride in building strong partnerships with our clients through transparency, loyalty, and results that speak for themselves.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Leadership That Works</h2>
      <p>Our leadership team is composed of industry veterans who’ve walked the floor, responded to critical system failures, led shutdowns, and managed crews through major infrastructure upgrades. We don’t lead from conference rooms — we lead from the field. CurtRidge Solutions is built for people who expect more from their contractors. We’re here to deliver.</p>
